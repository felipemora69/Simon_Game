# Simon_Game
C# Collaboration Project

Simon Game is a fun and interactive memory game where the player needs to memorize a sequence of colors generated by the computer and repeat them in the same order. The sequence gets progressively longer as the player successfully replicates the sequence, and the game continues until the player makes a mistake.

Features
Color Sequence: The game randomly generates a sequence of colors.
Player Input: The player must click the corresponding color buttons in the same order as the displayed sequence.
Level Progression: The game advances to higher levels as the player successfully replicates the sequence.
Game Over: The game ends when the player makes an incorrect sequence input.
High Score: Player scores are saved and displayed after every game session.
Interactive UI: A user-friendly interface where the player can start a new game, view the high score, and track their progress.

This project was a collaborative effort by a team of 5 people. Each member contributed to the design, development, and testing of the game.
